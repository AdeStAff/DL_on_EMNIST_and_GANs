# Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection & GAN Mode Collapse in EMNIST/MNIST

This project was part of my Master's in Data Science for Business at HEC Paris and Ã‰cole Polytechnique. It focuses on two key deep learning challenges: anomaly detection in corrupted EMNIST data and mode collapse in GANs trained on MNIST.

## Project Overview
1. **Anomaly Detection in a Corrupted EMNIST Dataset**
    - Develop techniques for anomaly detection.
    - Recover the original dataset.
    - Define and apply evaluation metrics.

2. **Exploring GAN Mode Collapse on MNIST**
    - Force of a GAN mode collapse using the MNIST dataset.
    - Extand to other datasets.

## Results & Code
See the full approach and results in the [notebook](DL_on_EMNIST_mode_collapse_GANs.ipynb).
